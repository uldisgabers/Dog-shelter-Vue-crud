  <h1>Paws Haven - A Sanctuary for Strays</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Paws Haven, where compassion meets canine companionship! Founded
    in 2024, Paws Haven is not just a dog shelter; it's a haven for those with
    fur, a place where tails wag and hearts heal. Our mission is simple yet
    profound: to provide a safe, loving environment for every dog in need,
    giving them a second chance at a happy, healthy life.
  </p>
  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <p>
    Paws Haven began as a heartfelt endeavor by a group of dedicated animal
    lovers who couldn't turn a blind eye to the plight of homeless dogs. Fueled
    by a passion for making a difference, our founders embarked on a journey to
    create a haven where dogs of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds could find
    refuge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since our inception, Paws Haven has grown into a vibrant community of
    volunteers, staff, and supporters, all driven by a shared commitment to the
    well-being of our four-legged friends. We believe that every dog, regardless
    of their past, deserves a future filled with love, care, and endless tail
    wags.
